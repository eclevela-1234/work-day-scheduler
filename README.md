## Final Thoughts
I struggled to get motivated for this one but I'm glad I did. jQuery proved to be quite efficient at building DOM elements. I also deepened my understanding of Bootstrap. Learning all new syntaxes for various libraries for the fifth week in a row pushed me to rely on documentation, and therefore get better at learning from it and researching.

**Proud Moment! -** Figuting out how to trigger the save button when it was in conflict with a blur event and successfully storing the textarea data to localstorage.
